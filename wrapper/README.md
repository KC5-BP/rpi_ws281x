For the default README, check ![here](../README.md)

### Background:
I wanted a library to control addressable LEDs (while developing, specificly WS2812B) \
and I discovered the rpi_ws281x repo. of user _jgarff_.

### In depth
wrapper is a folder that I created to wrap default function and 
I have duplicate the configuration files (SConstruct, SConscript & pkg-config.pc.in) \
to modify them and fit with my needed and names.
